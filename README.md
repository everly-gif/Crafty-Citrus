# How to run the app locally ?

### 1. Install and start a server.
Preffered WAMP , However other servers can be used as well.
### 2. Navigate to the cloned project directory
In WAMP you would have to navigate to the WWW directory and find your project directory.

### 3. Import data
Go to your phpMyAdmin and click on **Import** on the command pane. Navigate to the database-dump folder in the project directory and select the sql file inside it to import the contents to your local server.

### 4. Change Credentials (optional)

Your phpMyAdmin may have a different user credentials. By default ` username is root` and `password is empty (leave blank)`.
But if you had customized it during your installation then navigate to **partials** folder > db.php and make the necessary changes there.

### 5. Go to your port and view website
In **WAMP**
The website url will be available at 

```
localhost/<your clone destination>/crafty-citrus
```

<em>**For any help with code please raise an issue, we will get back to you shortly.**</em>
